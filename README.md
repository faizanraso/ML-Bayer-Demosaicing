<h1 align="" id="title">Bayer Demosaicing Using Linear Regression</h1>

<p id="description">Many assume that the captured images that we view on our cameras represent what its sensors captured. However photo sensors are highly sensitive to a wide range of light thus making them unable to distinguish between different colours. In order to obtain coloured images cameras use what are known as Colour Filter Arrays (CFA). When using a CFA each pixel is represented by one of the three primary colours red green or blue. Cameras that use CFA‚Äôs commonly store image colours in what is known as a Bayer Pattern. To retrieve an image with accurate colours demosaicing algorithms are used to determine the true colours of the image. This lab explores the use of a linear regression based demosaicing algorithm how it is implemented and the accuracy it yields.</p>
